Database management system
===============================================================================
There are 3 most popular databases:
    - SQLite
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL - is very powerful and good management system and because of that it
is used for more advanced projects. It is not very popular among users.

MySQL - doesn't completely support SQL standard. Very heavy advantage of MySQL
is that it is installed on a lot of servers on the web, because almost all
web-sites used MySQL.

SQLite - fully supports SQL and used for embedded applications. It is easy,
light database. Used for single-user applications.
